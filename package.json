  "description": "User Stories 🐿️ As a user, I want to sign up and log in securely using Clerk so that I can interact with the app as a user on the site and edit my user profile. 🐿️ As a user, I want to see an error/not found page (using error.js or not-found.js) if I try to visit a page on the site which doesn’t exist. 🐿️ As a user, I want an enhanced user experience with modern UI components, such as using a Radix UI Primitive or a similar library, so that the interface is more intuitive and visually appealing. 🐿️ As a user, I want to create and manage my profile, including adding information like a biography, so that I can personalise my account. 🐿️ As a user, I want to create my posts to be displayed on my profile page so that I can share and manage my content easily. Requirements 🎯 Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk. 🎯 Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits a page that doesn’t exist. 🎯 Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive component, or something similar (e.g. use of a different component library to enhance UX, not just Tailwind). 🎯 Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route. 🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the user’s profile page. How to Deploy Next.js was developed by Vercel, which is where we’re going to deploy our app, so some of the difficulties faced when deploying are reduced.",
